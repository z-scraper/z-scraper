# 👋 Hi, I'm Z (aka Z Scraper)

I build high-performance APIs for:

- 🪙 **Crypto news & sentiment analysis**
- 👔 **LinkedIn data for lead gen & recruiting**

## 🚀 What I’m working on

### 1. Crypto API

- Aggregates crypto news from 6 major sources (Bitcoinist, CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Crypto Daily, Crypto News, Decrypt)
- AI-powered sentiment (positive / negative / neutral)
- Edge network (Cloudflare Workers) with sub-100ms response times
- Perfect for: trading bots, DeFi dashboards, research tools

### 2. LinkedIn API

- Profiles, jobs, companies, posts, comments, reactions & more
- Advanced people / job / company search with 20+ filters
- Built on Cloudflare Workers with multi-account, anti-rate-limit setup
- Perfect for: recruiters, lead-gen tools, market research
